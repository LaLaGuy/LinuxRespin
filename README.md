If you are using Ubuntu - Consider switching to Debian.
This is NOT officially for Ubuntu. 
Debian.

We have an Ubuntu GTK version now.
Thank you to the members of the Ubuntu Community for working with us!!!

<b>We were also featured in LinuxJournal! </b>

Awesome everyone!

<b>A Note about the modified version we use:</b>
Here's the real deal: in 2014 we worked with Tony Brijeski (aka Fragadelic) on the fork - Respin. We had Ubuntu Developers and Debian Developers. Tony worked with us to get the original code and GTK and GUI versions for Ubuntu and Debian respectively.

The group lost speed and focused on their lives, careers and the Ubuntu version was stale. 

I will always give credit to Antoni Norman, aka Pinguy for the portion of his code that is included and thank the Bohdi guys for the part based from BohdiBuilder code in release 2.0-1+ Ubuntu. 
Ubuntu users were demanding an Ubuntu version. In fact, I did receive a threat from one person and multiple demands. I am not an Ubuntu developer. In fact, the only thing I ever created Ubuntu based is:
FixedUbuntu Opty Out for 14.04 - the Sassy Spyware version that did not have an easy option to opt out of spyware.

Some changes have been pushed and the source for 2.1.1-1 is available - dev not released.
